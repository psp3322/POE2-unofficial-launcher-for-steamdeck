> **Disclaimer**: This is an **unofficial** launcher for **Path of Exile** & **Path of Exile 2**. It is not affiliated with Grinding Gear Games or Kakao Games. Use at your own risk.

An Electron-based unofficial launcher designed to automate the launch process for **Path of Exile** and **Path of Exile 2**. It supports both Kawao Games and Grinding Gear Games (GGG) platforms, providing a streamlined experience by automatically handling login, Designated PC checks, and intro modals.

## Key Features

- **Automated Game Launch**: Automatically handles the entire launch sequence for **Path of Exile 1 & 2** (Kakao Games / GGG).
- **Popup Automation**: Checks and confirms "Designated PC" (지정 PC), "Login Required", and "Intro" modals without user intervention.
- **DaumGameStarter UAC Bypass**: Launches the game immediately without User Account Control (UAC) prompts (based on Windows Scheduler).
- **Patch Error Auto-fix**: Automatically detects and recovers from persistent patch errors such as 'Transferred a partial file'.
- **Dual Window Architecture**:
  - **Main Window**: Clean UI for launcher status and control.
  - **Background Processing**: Handles the actual Daum Game Starter web process in an inactive window, invisible to the user.
- **Secure Handling**: Does not store password data; relies on session cookies and existing browser login states where possible.
